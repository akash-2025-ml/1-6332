Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D1,WARNING,0.80,"Authentication failures (SPF softfail, DKIM policy, DMARC fail) combined with high exfiltration behavior score (0.90). Sender domain reputation moderate (0.67) but temp email likelihood high (0.48). No confirmed malware but behavioral anomalies require user verification per Rule 9."
D2,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Packer detected (1) with ActiveX objects (1) triggering Rule 5: dangerous code execution. High behavioral sandbox score (0.56) and maximum exfiltration score (0.99). Good sender reputation overridden by confirmed threat indicators requiring immediate blocking."
D3,WARNING,0.75,"Legal threat request with poor sender reputation (1.15e-08) and authentication failures (SPF fail, DMARC temperror). No confirmed malware but high-risk request type combined with auth issues warrants user verification per Rule 11 and social engineering patterns."
D4,SPAM,0.85,"Poor sender reputation (0.0015) with authentication failure (DMARC fail) but no confirmed threats. High exfiltration score (0.77) without malware components suggests spam classification per Rule 17. Behavioral anomalies insufficient for malicious without confirmation."
D5,SPAM,0.80,"Very poor sender reputation (4.93e-10) with authentication failures (DKIM fail, DMARC fail) and high spam score (0.69). No malicious components detected. Pattern indicates bulk spam distribution per Rule 17 without confirmed threats."
D6,WARNING,0.70,"Invoice verification request (high-risk financial) with SSL certificate issues (self-signed) and authentication concerns (DKIM neutral). Mixed authentication results with financial request type require user verification per Rule 10 - suspicious financial requests."
D7,NO ACTION,0.80,"All authentication passed (SPF/DKIM/DKIM pass) with valid TLS and good security posture. Despite high exfiltration score (0.90), lack of confirmed threats and strong authentication suggest clean email per Rule 20 - legitimate business patterns."
D8,MALICIOUS,0.90,"Total_components_detected_malicious=1 triggers Rule 2: confirmed malicious components require immediate blocking. Poor sender reputation and authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM policy) support the classification. SSL self-signed adds risk confirmation."
D9,SPAM,0.85,"Return path mismatch (1) with high temp email likelihood (0.79) and multiple authentication failures (SPF/DKIM/DMARC fail). Expired SSL certificate and poor reputation without confirmed malware indicates spam campaign per Rule 17."
D10,WARNING,0.65,"Meeting request with moderate behavioral scores (sandbox=0.06, exfiltration=0.65) and mixed authentication (DKIM policy). URL present with moderate threat indicators. Request type and behavioral anomalies warrant verification per Rule 9 - mixed signals."
D11,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Total_components_detected_malicious=3 with sensitive data request triggers Rule 2: confirmed malicious components override all other signals. SSL self-signed and high SMTP reputation (0.88) cannot override confirmed threat detection requiring immediate blocking."
D12,SPAM,0.75,"High spam score with authentication failures (SPF fail) and SSL certificate issues (self-signed). Poor sender reputation (0.0003) but no confirmed malware. Strong spam indicators without threats per Rule 14 - high spam probability classification."
D13,NO ACTION,0.85,"Good sender reputation (0.41) with no confirmed threats and very low behavioral scores. Despite minor authentication issues (DKIM policy), overall clean profile with no high-risk requests warrants no action per Rule 21 - false positive indicators."
D14,NO ACTION,0.80,"Link click request with very low threat scores across all behavioral metrics. Good SSL certificate (valid) and no confirmed threats. Clean security profile despite authentication issues (SPF/DKIM fail) per Rule 20 - legitimate patterns."
D15,WARNING,0.70,"High behavioral sandbox score (0.32) and maximum exfiltration score (0.91) with authentication failures (DKIM fail, DMARC fail). Good sender reputation (0.83) but mixed threat signals require verification per Rule 9 - behavioral concerns without confirmation."
D16,WARNING,0.75,"Invoice payment request (financial high-risk) with URL present and authentication issues (DKIM fail). Poor sender reputation (2.1e-06) with financial request type requires user verification per Rule 10 - suspicious financial patterns needing confirmation."
D17,WARNING,0.65,"Mixed authentication results (DKIM fail, DMARC fail) with moderate behavioral sandbox score (0.24). Good sender reputation (0.16) but authentication inconsistencies and behavioral anomalies warrant verification per Rule 11 - authentication inconsistencies."
D18,NO ACTION,0.85,"Meeting request with good sender reputation (0.57) and authentication (SPF pass). Very low threat scores across all behavioral metrics. Clean profile with legitimate business communication patterns per Rule 20 - legitimate business email."
D19,MALICIOUS,0.90,"Total_components_detected_malicious=3 with invoice verification request and ActiveX objects (1) triggers Rule 2: confirmed malicious components override good authentication. High-risk financial request with confirmed threats requires immediate blocking."
D20,SPAM,0.80,"Authentication failures (SPF fail) with SSL certificate mismatch and high spam score (0.22). Poor reputation but no confirmed threats. Invoice verification with mixed signals suggests spam rather than malicious per Rule 17."
D21,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Total_components_detected_malicious=1 with gift card request triggers Rule 2: confirmed malicious components require immediate blocking. Expired SSL certificate and authentication failures (SPF fail) support classification. Financial fraud pattern confirmed."
D22,NO ACTION,0.90,"DMARC enforced (1) with good authentication (SPF pass, DKIM pass) and very low threat scores. High sender reputation and clean security profile require no action per Rule 19 - clean security profile with strong authentication."
D23,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Total_yara_match_count=7 with credential request and URL shortener detected triggers Rule 2: confirmed YARA matches indicate known malware patterns. High-risk request type with confirmed threats requires immediate blocking per malware rules."
D24,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Executable attachment (1) with max_exfiltration_behavior_score=0.575 > 0.50 triggers Rule 4: executable threats with high behavioral scores require immediate blocking. High-risk targeting (1) and authentication failures support classification."
D25,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Final_url_known_malicious=1 with meeting request triggers Rule 1: known malicious URL destination requires immediate blocking. SSL self-signed and poor reputation support classification. Malicious destination overrides other signals."
D26,SPAM,0.75,"Authentication failures (DKIM fail, DMARC fail) with SSL certificate mismatch and poor sender reputation (0.007). No confirmed threats but strong spam patterns without malicious indicators per Rule 17 - authentication failures with spam."
D27,NO ACTION,0.80,"Good authentication (SPF pass) with very low threat scores and no confirmed malware. Clean profile with legitimate characteristics despite minor SSL mismatch per Rule 20 - legitimate business with minor technical issues."
D28,NO ACTION,0.85,"Link click request with good authentication (SPF pass) and very low behavioral scores. Marketing keywords present (1) but clean security profile with no threats detected per Rule 20 - legitimate marketing content."
D29,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Total_components_detected_malicious=1 with document download request and very high AMSI score (0.78) triggers Rule 2: confirmed malicious components require immediate blocking. High behavioral and AMSI scores support threat classification."
D30,WARNING,0.70,"Total_ioc_count=2 with ActiveX objects (1) and high exfiltration score (0.89) creates mixed threat signals. Good authentication (SPF pass) but IOC detections and behavioral anomalies require verification per Rule 9 - mixed signals analysis."
