Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D1,Warning,0.80,Authentication failures (SPF softfail DMARC fail) combined with high exfiltration behavior score (0.902) raise concerns. While sender has decent reputation (0.668) and no malicious content detected the behavioral anomaly and authentication issues warrant caution. Could be legitimate sender with security issues or early-stage attack.
D2,Malicious,0.90,Packer detected (obfuscation) ActiveX objects and extreme exfiltration score (0.993) indicate active malware. These are tools designed to infect and steal data. Failed authentication despite good domain reputation suggests compromised account. Clear intent to deceive and damage through malicious attachments.
D3,Malicious,0.85,Legal threat request type creates PRESSURE and attempts to FRIGHTEN recipients into action - key criteria for malicious classification. Very high spam score (0.894) with poor reputation and complete authentication failures. Uses legal intimidation to deceive and manipulate behavior. Goal is to frighten and pressure not just advertise making this malicious.
D4,Warning,0.70,Mixed signals present: very low spam score (0.085) and SPF passes but high exfiltration behavior score (0.770) is concerning. Poor sender domain reputation with behavioral anomaly despite no malicious content detected. Requires verification before trusting as behavioral score could indicate hidden threats.
D5,Spam,0.90,Classic spam profile: very poor sender reputation high spam score (0.689) failed authentication. No malicious attachments or urgent requests. This is unsolicited bulk advertising - annoying but not directly harmful. No attempt to steal or damage.
D6,No Action,0.85,Invoice verification is expected business communication. SPF passes low spam score (0.101) no malicious content. Self-signed SSL common for small businesses. No pressure tactics or deception. Appears to be legitimate relevant business content from known source.
D7,No Action,0.95,Perfect authentication (SPF DKIM DMARC all pass). Good reputation scores no malicious content no urgent requests. High exfiltration score appears to be false positive given all other indicators show trusted sender. Expected legitimate communication.
D8,Malicious,0.85,Malicious component detected - clear indicator of harmful content. Very high spam score failed authentication poor reputation. This goes beyond advertising to actual malware delivery. Intent to infect or steal not just annoy.
D9,Warning,0.75,Return path mismatch high temporary email (0.788) and complete authentication failures are red flags. Expired SSL suspicious. But no malicious content detected and low spam score. Classic "check before trust" scenario - too many oddities to trust but not proven harmful.
D10,Warning,0.65,Meeting request with passing authentication but moderate spam score (0.334) is concerning for business communication. No malicious content detected but behavioral scores and spam level warrant verification. Could be legitimate meeting or social engineering attempt requiring caution.
D11,Malicious,0.95,Sensitive data request (pressure tactic) with THREE malicious components detected. This is textbook malicious email - fake request designed to steal information with actual malware present. Clear intent to deceive and damage.
D12,Warning,0.70,Suspicious metadata and behavioral scores but no malicious content found. Failed authentication concerning but good SMTP reputation. No urgent requests. Falls into suspicious category requiring caution but not proven harmful.
D13,Spam,0.95,Extremely high spam score (0.976) with no malicious content. No urgent requests or deception attempts. Classic unsolicited bulk message - annoying but not harmful. Authentication issues common with spam operations.
D14,Spam,0.90,Very high spam score (0.966) with link click request but no malicious content. Failed authentication but valid SSL. This is advertising spam trying to drive traffic not steal information or infect systems.
D15,No Action,0.85,Excellent sender reputation (0.829) low spam score no malicious content. Authentication issues appear to be technical problems not deception. No pressure or urgent requests. Trusted sender with configuration issues.
D16,Malicious,0.95,Invoice payment request (financial pressure) with KNOWN MALICIOUS DOMAIN. This is fraud attempt - fake invoice designed to steal money. Clear deception with malicious infrastructure. Textbook phishing attack.
D17,Warning,0.70,SPF passes but elevated behavioral score (0.370) is concerning. No malicious content detected but moderate sender reputation combined with behavioral anomaly suggests something unusual. No urgent requests but pattern warrants verification before full trust.
D18,No Action,0.90,Meeting request with good reputation (0.566) very low spam score SPF passes. No malicious content or pressure tactics. DKIM error is technical issue. Expected business communication from trusted source.
D19,Malicious,0.90,Invoice verification (financial context) with THREE malicious components. High temporary email suggests impersonation. Despite some good authentication the malicious content and financial deception attempt make this clearly harmful.
D20,Warning,0.70,SSL certificate mismatch combined with moderate spam score (0.613) raises suspicions. No malicious content detected but infrastructure concerns and spam profile unusual for legitimate email. DMARC passes but certificate issues warrant verification.
D21,Malicious,0.95,Gift card request is classic pressure tactic for financial theft. Malicious component detected failed authentication expired SSL. This is impersonation attack designed to trick employees into buying gift cards. Clear deception and harm intent.
D22,Spam,0.65,High spam score (0.656) with temporary email likelihood (0.297) typical of bulk senders. No malicious content no urgent requests. DMARC enforced but appears to be legitimate spam operation not harmful attack.
D23,Malicious,0.98,Credential request (steal passwords) with SEVEN YARA matches indicating known malware. URL shortener hiding destination. This is sophisticated attack designed to steal login credentials. Extremely dangerous with clear harmful intent.
D24,Malicious,0.95,EXECUTABLE ATTACHMENT - primary method to infect systems. Failed authentication SSL mismatch high behavioral scores all confirm malicious intent. Executable files with these indicators equal malware delivery attempt.
D25,Malicious,0.90,FINAL URL KNOWN MALICIOUS - the destination is confirmed harmful. Meeting request is deception to trick clicking malicious link. Clear phishing attack with proven malicious endpoint.
D26,No Action,0.95,Excellent profile: very low spam score (0.032) good authentication valid SSL. No suspicious content or requests. All indicators point to legitimate expected communication from trusted source.
D27,Spam,0.95,Extremely high spam score (0.874) with no malicious content. Failed authentication typical of bulk senders. No pressure tactics or harmful attachments. Classic unsolicited advertising - annoying not dangerous.
D28,Spam,0.70,High spam score (0.660) with unsubscribe link present - typical marketing email characteristics. Link click request common in promotional emails. SPF passes suggesting legitimate marketing rather than malicious activity.
D29,Malicious,0.98,Document download request (pressure) with MALICIOUS COMPONENT and extreme behavioral scores showing active malware. This is malware delivery attempting data theft. Clear harmful intent through infected document.
D30,Warning,0.80,Two IOCs detected is concerning but extremely high spam score (0.979) suggests bulk messaging rather than targeted attack. Meeting request context unusual for spam. Mixed signals require verification - could be compromised account or sophisticated spam campaign rather than direct malware.
