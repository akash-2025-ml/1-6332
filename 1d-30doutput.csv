Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D1,WARNING,0.75,High exfiltration score (0.90) and moderate suspicious metadata suggest potential threat. However no confirmed malware/YARA matches authentication mostly failed (SPF softfail DKIM policy DMARC fail). Request type is none with low spam score. Infrastructure appears legitimate despite auth issues. Mixed signals warrant user verification before action.
D2,WARNING,0.70,Packer detected (1) raises concern along with high exfiltration behavior (0.99) and moderate sandbox score (0.56). ActiveX detected increases risk. However no confirmed malicious components or YARA hits. Authentication failures across board. Very high reply-path reputation anomaly. Requires careful manual review given executable risks.
D3,WARNING,0.65,Legal threat request type is high manipulation risk per rules. Authentication completely failed (SPF fail no DKIM DMARC temperror). High spam score (0.89) indicates unwanted content. However all threat scores near zero no malicious indicators. Likely spam using legal threats for social engineering but not technically malicious.
D4,WARNING,0.70,High exfiltration behavior score (0.77) concerning. Failed DMARC despite SPF/DKIM pass shows spoofing attempt. Multiple embedded files (7) with moderate execution time suspicious. Two URLs detected. Mixed authentication and behavioral signals indicate potential phishing attempt requiring verification.
D5,SPAM,0.85,Clean threat profile with all malicious indicators at zero. Moderate spam score (0.69) and bulk-like characteristics. Failed authentication (SPF pass but DKIM/DMARC fail) typical of spam. No executable threats or suspicious behaviors. Classic spam pattern without malicious intent.
D6,WARNING,0.72,Invoice verification request with self-signed SSL certificate major red flag. Good authentication but infrastructure concerns. No malware detected but invoice requests with SSL issues indicate potential fraud attempt. Requires manual verification of sender legitimacy before processing any invoice.
D7,WARNING,0.75,High exfiltration score (0.90) concerning despite low other scores. Self-signed SSL certificate adds risk. All authentication passed which is positive. No confirmed threats but behavioral anomalies with infrastructure issues warrant careful review especially with embedded file present.
D8,MALICIOUS,0.82,Total components detected malicious = 1 triggers automatic malicious classification per Rule 2. Additionally shows high spam score (0.81) self-signed SSL and complete authentication failure. Confirmed malware presence makes this definitive threat requiring immediate blocking.
D9,WARNING,0.68,Return path mismatch (1) with complete authentication failure suspicious. Moderate sender temp email likelihood (0.79). SSL expired adds concern. However no confirmed malware and low threat scores. Likely phishing attempt but not confirmed malicious requiring user awareness.
D10,WARNING,0.65,Meeting request with moderate exfiltration score (0.65) and some authentication issues (DKIM policy). One URL present but valid SSL. Mixed signals - legitimate meeting requests shouldn't have behavioral anomalies. Requires verification of sender identity before accepting meeting.
D11,MALICIOUS,0.88,Total components detected malicious = 3 automatically classifies as malicious per Rule 2. Additionally shows sensitive data request type with self-signed SSL. Very high SMTP reputation score suspicious. Confirmed malware with data theft attempt clear malicious intent.
D12,WARNING,0.70,High exfiltration score (0.69) with embedded file concerning. Self-signed SSL and failed SPF add risk. High spam score (0.65) but no confirmed malware. Behavioral anomalies without confirmed threats indicate sophisticated attempt requiring careful analysis.
D13,NO ACTION,0.85,Clean security profile with no malicious indicators. Good sender reputation (0.41). Some auth issues (SPF softfail) but common for legitimate senders. Low spam score valid SSL no threats detected. Two URLs but normal for business email. Legitimate communication.
D14,WARNING,0.72,Link click request with high spam score (0.97) suspicious. Complete authentication failure concerning. Two URLs detected. However no malware or high behavioral scores. Likely phishing link but not confirmed malicious. User should verify before clicking any links.
D15,WARNING,0.78,High exfiltration score (0.91) with moderate sandbox behavior concerning. Failed authentication (DKIM fail DMARC fail) despite neutral SPF. Good sender reputation contradicts auth failures. Mixed signals suggest spoofing attempt requiring verification.
D16,MALICIOUS,0.90,Domain known malicious = 1 triggers automatic malicious classification per Rule 1. Additionally shows invoice payment request with high sandbox score (0.56). Three embedded files with suspicious patterns. Known malicious domain confirms this as active threat campaign.
D17,NO ACTION,0.80,Despite some authentication issues (DKIM/DMARC fail) shows low threat scores across board. No request type valid SSL moderate behavioral scores within acceptable range. High SMTP ASN score but offset by other clean indicators. Likely legitimate with technical issues.
D18,NO ACTION,0.82,Good authentication (SPF pass) with meeting request type. Low threat scores throughout. Sender temp email likelihood moderate but common for scheduling systems. Valid SSL no malware clean behavioral profile. Legitimate meeting invitation.
D19,MALICIOUS,0.85,Total components detected malicious = 3 automatically classifies as malicious per Rule 2. Invoice verification request adds financial fraud risk. ActiveX detected increases threat. Moderate sandbox and exfiltration scores confirm malicious behavior pattern.
D20,WARNING,0.70,SSL mismatch concerning for any communication. High SMTP ASN score (0.43) suspicious. Failed SPF but passed DMARC unusual. Moderate exfiltration behavior (0.64) concerning. No confirmed malware but infrastructure anomalies warrant verification.
D21,MALICIOUS,0.83,Total components detected malicious = 1 triggers automatic malicious classification per Rule 2. Gift card request matches fraud pattern in Rule 6. SSL expired adds infrastructure concern. High exfiltration score (0.48) confirms data theft attempt.
D22,NO ACTION,0.88,DMARC enforced (1) strong security indicator. All authentication passed. Clean threat profile with near-zero malicious scores. Two URLs but normal for legitimate email. Despite high spam score shows strong security posture of legitimate sender.
D23,MALICIOUS,0.92,Total YARA match count = 7 triggers automatic malicious classification per Rule 2. Credential request type with URL shortener extremely suspicious. High AMSI score (0.46) confirms malicious macros/scripts. Clear credential theft attempt with confirmed malware signatures.
D24,MALICIOUS,0.87,Has executable attachment = 1 with failed authentication triggers high risk. SSL mismatch for executable delivery major red flag. Moderate exfiltration score (0.58) confirms malicious intent. Executable threats with auth failures indicate malware distribution.
D25,MALICIOUS,0.85,Final URL known malicious = 1 confirms malicious destination. Meeting request with malicious URL is spear phishing. Three URLs with one confirmed malicious. Self-signed SSL adds risk. Clear phishing campaign targeting users with meeting invites.
D26,NO ACTION,0.83,Clean malicious indicators throughout. Good SPF pass legitimate TLS. SSL mismatch minor concern but common for legitimate services. Very low threat scores no suspicious behavior. Normal business communication with technical quirks.
D27,SPAM,0.75,Multiple authentication failures (SPF fail DKIM fail DMARC temperror) with very high spam score (0.87). No confirmed malware and no high-risk requests. Moderate SMTP geo risk (0.57) typical of spam sources. Valid SSL but poor return/reply path reputation. Clear spam pattern per Rule 17.
D28,SPAM,0.82,High spam score (0.66) with unsubscribe link present (1) clear spam indicators. Link click request but no malicious components. Self-signed SSL typical of spam infrastructure. Authentication mixed but no threats detected. Commercial spam not malicious.
D29,MALICIOUS,0.88,Total components detected malicious = 1 triggers automatic malicious classification per Rule 2. Document download request with very high exfiltration score (0.95). High AMSI score (0.78) indicates malicious scripts. Four URLs increase attack surface. Confirmed malware delivery attempt.
D30,WARNING,0.80,High exfiltration score (0.89) and IOC count = 2 concerning but no confirmed malware detected. ActiveX present adds risk. Authentication all passed (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) positive signal. Very high spam score (0.98) but behavioral anomalies without confirmed threats indicate sophisticated attempt requiring manual verification.
