Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D1,WARNING,0.75,"Authentication failures (SPF softfail, DKIM policy, DMARC fail) with high behavioral scores (max_exfiltration_behavior_score=0.90). No confirmed malware but mixed threat signals warrant user verification before processing."
D2,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Packer detected (1) with ActiveX objects present (1) and high behavioral/exfiltration scores (0.56/0.99). Rule 5 triggered: dangerous code execution patterns requiring immediate blocking."
D3,WARNING,0.70,"Legal threat request type with authentication failures and poor sender reputation. Multiple authentication issues (SPF/DKIM fail, DMARC temperror) suggest spoofing attempt requiring verification."
D4,SPAM,0.80,"High spam indicators with authentication failures (DMARC fail) but no confirmed malware. Poor sender reputation (0.0015) with bulk messaging patterns and no high-risk requests."
D5,SPAM,0.85,"Multiple authentication failures (DKIM/DMARC fail) with high content spam score (0.69). Very poor sender reputation but no malicious components detected, indicating spam rather than threats."
D6,WARNING,0.65,"Invoice verification request with SSL certificate issues (self-signed) and authentication concerns. Mixed signals requiring user verification before processing financial request."
D7,WARNING,0.70,"High exfiltration behavior score (0.90) with SSL certificate issues (self-signed) and good authentication otherwise. Behavioral anomalies warrant investigation despite no confirmed malware."
D8,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Total_components_detected_malicious=1 detected. Rule 2 triggered: confirmed malicious components require immediate blocking regardless of authentication or reputation signals."
D9,SPAM,0.80,"High temp email likelihood (0.79) with multiple authentication failures (SPF/DKIM/DMARC fail) and expired SSL certificate. Pattern suggests disposable email spam campaign."
D10,WARNING,0.60,"Meeting request with mixed authentication results and moderate behavioral scores (0.06/0.65). Behavioral anomalies and request type combination require user verification."
D11,MALICIOUS,0.90,"Sensitive data request with total_components_detected_malicious=3 detected. Rule 2 triggered: confirmed malicious components requiring immediate blocking regardless of other signals."
D12,SPAM,0.75,"High spam score with authentication failures (SPF fail) and SSL certificate issues (self-signed). No confirmed malware but strong spam indicators and poor reputation."
D13,NO ACTION,0.85,"Good sender reputation (0.41) with no confirmed threats, low behavioral scores, and no high-risk request types. Despite minor authentication issues, overall clean profile."
D14,NO ACTION,0.80,"No confirmed threats, very low behavioral scores, and legitimate authentication patterns. Link click request type with good SSL certificate and overall clean security profile."
D15,WARNING,0.65,"High behavioral sandbox score (0.32) and exfiltration score (0.91) with authentication failures (DKIM/DMARC fail). Mixed threat signals requiring verification before processing."
D16,WARNING,0.70,"Invoice payment request with URL present and authentication issues (DKIM fail). Financial request type with mixed authentication results requires user verification."
D17,WARNING,0.65,"Mixed authentication results (DKIM fail, DMARC fail) with moderate behavioral scores (0.24). No confirmed threats but authentication inconsistencies warrant verification."
D18,NO ACTION,0.85,"Good sender reputation (0.57) with meeting request type, good authentication (SPF pass), and very low threat scores. Clean profile with legitimate business communication patterns."
D19,MALICIOUS,0.85,"Invoice verification request with total_components_detected_malicious=3 and ActiveX objects detected (1). Rule 2 triggered: confirmed malicious components require immediate blocking."
D20,SPAM,0.80,"Authentication failures (SPF fail) with SSL certificate mismatch and high spam score (0.22). Poor security posture suggests spam classification without confirmed threats."
D21,MALICIOUS,0.90,"Gift card request with total_components_detected_malicious=1 and expired SSL certificate. Rule 2: confirmed malicious components override other signals for immediate blocking."
D22,NO ACTION,0.90,"DMARC enforced (1) with good authentication (SPF/DKIM pass) and very low threat scores. Clean security profile with legitimate characteristics requiring no action."
D23,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Credential request with total_yara_match_count=7 and URL shortener detected. Rule 2: confirmed YARA matches indicate known malware patterns requiring immediate blocking."
D24,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Executable attachment present (1) with max_exfiltration_behavior_score=0.575 > 0.50. Rule 4 triggered: executable threats with high behavioral scores require immediate blocking."
D25,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Final_url_known_malicious=1 detected. Rule 1 triggered: known malicious URL destination requires immediate blocking regardless of other signals."
D26,SPAM,0.75,"Authentication failures (DKIM fail, DMARC fail) with SSL certificate mismatch and poor sender reputation. Spam patterns without confirmed threats indicate bulk messaging."
D27,NO ACTION,0.80,"Good authentication (SPF pass) with very low threat scores and no confirmed malware. Clean profile with legitimate characteristics despite minor SSL mismatch."
D28,NO ACTION,0.85,"Link click request with good authentication (SPF pass) and very low behavioral scores. Clean security profile with marketing keywords but no threats detected."
D29,MALICIOUS,0.90,"Document download request with total_components_detected_malicious=1 and very high AMSI score (0.78). Rule 2: confirmed malicious components require immediate blocking."
D30,WARNING,0.65,"Total_ioc_count=2 with ActiveX objects (1) and high exfiltration score (0.89). IOC detections with behavioral anomalies require user verification before processing."
