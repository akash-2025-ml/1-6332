Request type 'none' with no malicious domains/hashes detected. DMARC not enforced, SPF softfail, DKIM policy failure indicate authentication concerns. Combination of high exfiltration potential with authentication issues suggests suspicious activity requiring investigation."
D2,Warning,0.82,"Packer detected (1) with extremely high exfiltration behavior (0.99), ActiveX objects present (1), and moderate behavioral sandbox score (0.56). No malicious hashes but authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM policy). While concerning behavioral indicators exist, request type is 'none' and no confirmed malicious domains. Mixed signals warrant caution and investigation."
D3,Malicious,0.94,"Legal threat request type with extremely low domain reputation (1.15e-08). Authentication failures across SPF/DKIM/DMARC (fail/none/temperror). The explicit social engineering through legal threats combined with extremely poor domain reputation and complete authentication breakdown clearly indicates malicious intent to manipulate victims through false legal pressure and fear tactics."
D4,Warning,0.78,"High suspicious string entropy (0.63), moderate exfiltration behavior (0.77), low behavioral sandbox score (0.0001) but moderate AMSI suspicion (0.11). Good authentication (SPF/DKIM pass, DMARC fail). Request type 'none' with no malicious indicators. Mixed behavioral signals with authentication inconsistency suggests caution warranted but not malicious."
D5,Warning,0.75,"Extremely low domain reputation (4.93e-10) with authentication failures (DKIM fail, DMARC fail) despite SPF pass. All behavioral scores are 0.0 with no malicious indicators detected. High domain tech stack match (1.0) suggests legitimate infrastructure, but the combination of near-zero domain reputation with authentication inconsistencies requires verification. While no active threats detected, the extremely poor reputation warrants caution before trust."
D6,Malicious,0.89,"Invoice verification request type (financial fraud attempt) with low domain reputation (0.08). Self-signed SSL certificate indicating poor security posture. Mixed authentication (SPF pass, DKIM neutral, DMARC none). The explicit financial fraud attempt through invoice verification combined with questionable infrastructure clearly indicates malicious business email compromise attempt."
D7,Warning,0.76,"High exfiltration behavior score (0.90), moderate metadata suspicious score (0.30), very low behavioral sandbox (0.0057) with self-signed SSL. Good authentication (SPF/DKIM pass, DMARC pass) but request type 'none'. The combination of high data exfiltration potential with unverified SSL but good authentication suggests legitimate communication through potentially compromised infrastructure."
D8,Warning,0.78,"Low domain reputation (4.54e-05), total components detected as malicious (1), self-signed SSL certificate. Authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM policy, DMARC none). Request type 'none' but presence of malicious components with poor authentication suggests suspicious activity requiring investigation before trust."
D9,Warning,0.74,"High sender temp email likelihood (0.79), return path mismatch (1), authentication failures across all protocols (SPF/DKIM fail, DMARC fail), expired SSL certificate. Request type 'none' but combination of temporary email indicators, path mismatches, and expired SSL suggests potentially fraudulent infrastructure."
D10,Malicious,0.88,"Meeting request type (social engineering) with moderate exfiltration behavior (0.65), moderate behavioral sandbox score (0.061). Low sender domain reputation (0.034) with mixed authentication. The social engineering attempt through fake meeting requests combined with data exfiltration behavior and poor sender reputation clearly indicates malicious phishing intent."
D11,Malicious,0.95,"Sensitive data request type with total components detected as malicious (3), self-signed SSL certificate. Authentication issues (SPF softfail, DKIM none, DMARC pass). The explicit request for sensitive information combined with confirmed malicious components and questionable SSL validity clearly indicates malicious data theft attempt with high confidence."
D12,Warning,0.79,"High exfiltration behavior (0.69), moderate metadata suspicious score (0.28), self-signed SSL certificate. Authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM neutral, DMARC none). Request type 'none' but combination of data exfiltration potential with authentication issues and unverified SSL suggests suspicious activity requiring investigation."
D13,No Action,0.83,"Moderate sender domain reputation (0.41), very high URL reputation (0.98), minimal behavioral scores. Mixed authentication (SPF softfail, DKIM policy, DMARC none) but request type 'none'. High URL reputation combined with moderate domain reputation suggests legitimate communication with authentication configuration issues rather than malicious intent."
D14,Malicious,0.89,"Link click request type with extremely low sender temp email likelihood (1.5e-23), authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM none, DMARC none). The explicit social engineering attempt to manipulate users into clicking potentially malicious links, combined with authentication failures, clearly indicates malicious phishing intent designed to compromise users."
D15,Warning,0.77,"High exfiltration behavior (0.91), moderate behavioral sandbox score (0.32), good sender reputation (0.83). Authentication failures (DKIM fail, DMARC fail). Request type 'none'. While sender reputation is good, the combination of concerning behavioral indicators with authentication issues suggests suspicious activity requiring verification."
D16,Malicious,0.94,"Invoice payment request type (financial fraud) with domain morphing detected (1), high return path reputation (0.90). Mixed authentication (SPF pass, DKIM fail, DMARC pass). The financial fraud attempt through fake invoice payments combined with domain morphing techniques clearly indicates malicious business email compromise designed to steal money."
D17,Warning,0.76,"Moderate metadata suspicious score (0.30), moderate behavioral sandbox (0.24) and exfiltration scores (0.045), high site visual similarity to known brand (0.37). Mixed authentication with self-signed SSL. Request type 'none'. Visual brand similarity with suspicious metadata suggests potential spoofing attempt requiring investigation."
D18,Warning,0.75,"Meeting request type with low sender domain reputation (0.165) and DKIM permerror indicating authentication issues. While meeting requests are legitimate business communications and sender temp email likelihood is very low (0.0008), the combination of poor sender reputation with authentication failure creates uncertainty about sender legitimacy. Requires verification before trust despite legitimate request type."
D19,Malicious,0.92,"Invoice verification request type (financial fraud) with high sender temp email likelihood (0.84), ActiveX objects (1), total components detected as malicious (3). Good authentication (SPF pass, DKIM none, DMARC pass). The financial fraud attempt combined with temporary email usage, ActiveX exploitation, and confirmed malicious components clearly indicates sophisticated business email compromise attack."
D20,Warning,0.73,"High URL reputation (0.61), SSL certificate mismatch, authentication issues (SPF fail, DKIM none, DMARC pass). Request type 'none'. While URL reputation suggests legitimate content, SSL certificate mismatch combined with authentication problems suggests technical security issues requiring verification."
D21,Malicious,0.96,"Gift card request type (classic fraud) with moderate metadata suspicious score (0.24), expired SSL certificate, total components detected as malicious (1). Authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM temperror, DMARC temperror). The explicit gift card fraud attempt combined with malicious components and expired SSL clearly indicates malicious social engineering attack designed to steal money."
D22,No Action,0.85,"DMARC enforced (1) with excellent authentication (SPF pass, DKIM pass), moderate sender temp email likelihood (0.30). Request type 'none', high URL reputation (0.65). Strong authentication controls with DMARC enforcement and good URL reputation indicate legitimate, well-configured email communication that poses minimal risk."

D24,Warning,0.81,"High-risk role targeted (1), executable attachment present (1), SSL certificate mismatch, moderate behavioral scores. Authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM fail, DMARC none). Request type 'none'. Targeting high-risk roles with executable attachments and SSL issues suggests sophisticated attack preparation requiring immediate investigation."
D25,Malicious,0.93,"Meeting request type with final URL known malicious (1), self-signed SSL certificate, moderate sender temp email likelihood (0.22). Authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM none, DMARC pass). The social engineering through fake meeting requests leading to confirmed malicious URLs clearly indicates malicious phishing designed to compromise users through deceptive calendar invites."
D26,Warning,0.74,"SSL certificate mismatch, moderate behavioral indicators, authentication failures (SPF pass, DKIM fail, DMARC fail). Request type 'none'. While no explicit malicious request detected, SSL certificate problems combined with authentication failures suggest potential security compromise requiring verification before trust."
D27,Warning,0.69,"Extremely low sender domain reputation (4.48e-07), SSL certificate mismatch, authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM fail, DMARC temperror). Request type 'none'. While behavioral indicators are minimal, the extremely poor domain reputation combined with SSL and authentication issues suggests questionable communication requiring verification."
D28,Warning,0.76,"Link click request type with marketing keywords detected (1) but complete authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM fail, DMARC temperror) create fundamental trust issues. While URL reputation is good (0.69) and content spam score is very low (0.000021) suggesting promotional content, the inability to verify sender identity due to authentication breakdown requires verification before trust. Authentication failure overrides promotional content indicators."
D29,Malicious,0.98,"Document download request type with extremely high AMSI suspicion (0.78), very high exfiltration behavior (0.95), high content spam score (0.71), total components detected as malicious (1). Authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM policy, DMARC permerror).
