Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D1,WARNING,0.75,"Rule 9: Mixed threat signals. Max_exfiltration_behavior_score=0.90 (>0.70) WITHOUT confirmed threats equals WARNING per Rule 3 note. Authentication failures (SPF softfail, DKIM policy, DMARC fail) with behavioral scores in high range but no confirmed malware detection (total_components_detected_malicious=0, total_yara_match_count=0). Mixed signals require user verification."
D2,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Rule 5: Dangerous code execution. Packer_detected=1 + any_active_x_objects_detected=1 triggers automatic MALICIOUS classification. This combination creates executable threat environment with obfuscation bypassing detection. Good sender reputation (0.78) overridden by confirmed dangerous code execution patterns requiring immediate blocking."
D3,WARNING,0.70,"Rule 12: Infrastructure concerns. Request_type='legal_threat' (high manipulation risk per special considerations) with authentication failures (SPF fail, DMARC temperror) WITHOUT confirmed threats. Very poor sender reputation (1.15e-08) but no malicious components detected. Legal threat manipulation creates infrastructure concern requiring verification."
D4,SPAM,0.80,"Rule 15: Poor sender reputation. Sender_domain_reputation_score=0.0015 < 0.10 with no confirmed threats and high spam patterns. Authentication failure (DMARC fail) supports spam classification. Max_exfiltration_behavior_score=0.77 high but without confirmed malware indicates behavioral false positive. No specific targeting detected."
D5,SPAM,0.85,"Rule 14: High spam probability. Content_spam_score=0.69 > 0.60 with no malicious components detected and no high-risk request types. Multiple authentication failures (DKIM fail, DMARC fail) support spam classification. Very poor sender reputation (4.93e-10) indicates spam distribution without security threats."
D6,WARNING,0.70,"Rule 10: Suspicious financial requests. Request_type='invoice_verification' (medium-risk financial) with mixed authentication (SPF pass, DKIM neutral, DMARC none) - some pass but not all. Behavioral scores < 0.40 and no confirmed malware. SSL self-signed adds infrastructure concern. Financial request requires user verification."
D7,WARNING,0.70,"Rule 12: Infrastructure concerns. SSL_validity_status='self_signed' WITHOUT confirmed threats creates infrastructure concern. Despite good authentication (SPF pass, DKIM pass, DMARC pass), self-signed certificate with high max_exfiltration_behavior_score=0.895 requires user verification per infrastructure concerns rule."
D8,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Rule 2: Confirmed malware detection. Total_components_detected_malicious=1 > 0 automatically triggers MALICIOUS classification. Authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM policy) and SSL self-signed support classification. Confirmed malicious components override all other signals requiring immediate blocking."
D9,WARNING,0.70,"Rule 12: Infrastructure concerns. SSL_validity_status='expired' WITHOUT confirmed threats creates infrastructure concern. Multiple authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM fail, DMARC fail) and return_path_mismatch_with_from=1 but content_spam_score=0.007 < 0.60 doesn't meet Rule 17 spam threshold. Infrastructure concerns require user verification."
D10,WARNING,0.65,"Rule 9: Mixed threat signals. Behavioral scores (max_behavioral_sandbox_score=0.06, max_exfiltration_behavior_score=0.65) between 0.30-0.70 range with no confirmed malware detection and authentication concerns (DKIM policy). Request_type='meeting_request' with behavioral anomalies warrant user verification."
D11,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Rule 2: Confirmed malware detection. Total_components_detected_malicious=3 > 0 automatically triggers MALICIOUS classification. Request_type='sensitive_data_request' (medium-risk) with confirmed malicious components. Authentication issues and SSL self-signed support classification. Confirmed threats override all signals."
D12,SPAM,0.75,"Rule 15: Poor sender reputation. Sender_domain_reputation_score=0.0003 < 0.10 with no confirmed threats and high spam patterns. Authentication failures (SPF fail) and SSL self-signed support spam classification. No high-risk request types or specific targeting detected."
D13,NO ACTION,0.80,"Rule 21: False positive indicators. All behavioral scores < 0.05 (very low across all threats) with good sender_domain_reputation_score=0.41. Despite minor authentication issues (SPF softfail, DKIM policy), very low threat scores and good reputation override technical issues indicating legitimate email."
D14,NO ACTION,0.80,"Rule 21: False positive indicators. Request_type='link_click' with all behavioral scores < 0.05 and good SSL certificate (valid). Despite authentication issues (SPF fail, DKIM none), extremely low threat scores across all metrics and clean profile indicate legitimate email."
D15,WARNING,0.70,"Rule 9: Mixed threat signals. Max_exfiltration_behavior_score=0.906 (>0.70) WITHOUT confirmed threats equals WARNING per Rule 3 note. Authentication failures (DKIM fail, DMARC fail) with good sender reputation (0.83) but high behavioral scores without malware confirmation require user verification."
D16,WARNING,0.75,"Rule 10: Suspicious financial requests. Request_type='invoice_payment' (high-risk financial per risk levels) with authentication issues (DKIM fail). Mixed authentication results (SPF pass, DKIM fail) - some pass but not all. Behavioral scores moderate, no confirmed malware. Financial request requires verification."
D17,WARNING,0.65,"Rule 11: Authentication inconsistencies. Mixed authentication results (SPF pass, DKIM fail, DMARC fail) - some pass, some fail pattern with moderate behavioral scores. No confirmed malware but authentication inconsistencies with behavioral concerns (max_behavioral_sandbox_score=0.24) require verification."
D18,NO ACTION,0.85,"Rule 20: Legitimate business email. Request_type='meeting_request' with good sender reputation (0.57) and authentication (SPF pass). Very low threat scores across all behavioral metrics. No confirmed threats, clean security profile. Meeting request with legitimate patterns requires no action."
D19,MALICIOUS,0.90,"Rule 2: Confirmed malware detection. Total_components_detected_malicious=3 > 0 with any_active_x_objects_detected=1 triggers automatic MALICIOUS classification. Request_type='invoice_verification' with confirmed malicious components. Good authentication (SPF pass, DMARC pass) overridden by confirmed threats requiring immediate blocking."
D20,WARNING,0.70,"Rule 12: Infrastructure concerns. SSL_validity_status='mismatch' WITHOUT confirmed threats creates infrastructure concern. Poor sender_domain_reputation_score=0.002 with authentication failure (SPF fail) but content_spam_score=0.22 < 0.60 doesn't meet spam thresholds. Infrastructure concerns require user verification."
D21,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Rules 2 & 6: Confirmed malware + Financial fraud. Total_components_detected_malicious=1 > 0 triggers Rule 2. Additionally, request_type='gift_card_request' + authentication failures (SPF fail) triggers Rule 6. Both rules confirm MALICIOUS classification. Expired SSL and financial fraud pattern requiring immediate blocking."
D22,NO ACTION,0.90,"Rule 19: Clean security profile. DMARC_enforced=1 with good authentication (SPF pass, DKIM pass) and all malicious indicators=0.

Has_executable_attachment=1 AND max_exfiltration_behavior_score=0.575 > 0.50 AND authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM fail) triggers MALICIOUS classification. Is_high_risk_role_targeted=1 adds targeting concern. Executable with high behavioral scores requires immediate blocking."
D25,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Rule 1: Known threat indicators. Final_url_known_malicious=1 automatically triggers MALICIOUS classification regardless of other signals. Request_type='meeting_request' with known malicious URL destination overrides all other factors. SSL self-signed and authentication issues support but not required for classification."
D26,WARNING,0.70,"Rule 12: Infrastructure concerns. SSL_validity_status='mismatch' WITHOUT confirmed threats creates infrastructure concern. Multiple authentication failures (DKIM fail, DMARC fail) but content_spam_score=0.003 < 0.60 doesn't meet Rule 17 spam threshold. Infrastructure and authentication concerns require user verification."
D27,NO ACTION,0.80,"Rule 20: Legitimate business email. Request_type='none' with good authentication (SPF pass) and very low threat scores. No confirmed malware, clean behavioral profile.
