1. Safe Mail 

Definition: 
Messages that are legitimate, expected, and relevant to the recipient. 

Rule to classify: 

The sender is known and trusted. 

The message is expected or requested. 

The content is relevant and appropriate (work, family, services you use). 

No attempt to mislead, frighten, or pressure you. 

Examples: 

Your bank sending your monthly statement (if you signed up). 

A colleague replying to your email. 

A newsletter you subscribed to. 

2. Spam Mail 

Definition: 
Messages that are unsolicited and unwanted, usually promotional or irrelevant, but not directly harmful. 

Rule to classify: 

You did not ask for the message. 

It is sent to many people at once (bulk). 

Content is mainly advertising or irrelevant offers. 

Usually not dangerous, but annoying. 

Examples: 

Random sales offers you never signed up for. 

Mass emails about weight loss, loans, or lottery wins. 

Unwanted promotional newsletters. 

3. Malicious Mail 

Definition: 
Messages that try to cause harm — by stealing information, spreading viruses, or tricking you into unsafe actions. 

Rule to classify: 

The message pressures you into urgent action (click, download, pay, share password). 

It contains fake identity (pretends to be from your bank, employer, or government). 

It often includes links or attachments designed to infect or steal. 

Goal is to deceive or damage, not just advertise. 

Examples: 

“Your account is locked, click here to verify.” 

Fake invoices with malicious attachments. 

Phishing emails pretending to be tax refunds. 

4. Warning Mail 

Definition: 
Messages that are suspicious or unusual, not outright proven harmful, but raising concern. 

Rule to classify: 

Something looks out of place (odd sender name, strange wording, broken language). 

The message may come from a new or unexpected source. 

Not clearly spam or malicious, but uncertain enough to be cautious. 

Treated as “check before trust”. 

Examples: 

An email from a colleague’s personal Gmail about work. 

A sudden prize offer from a brand you once shopped at. 

A message with too many spelling errors, but no clear attack.
