D1,WARNING,0.80,"High exfiltration behavior score (0.90) with authentication failures (SPF softfail, DKIM policy, DMARC fail) but no confirmed malware. Sender reputation moderate (0.67), temp email likelihood elevated (0.48). URL reputation poor (0.015) with SSL valid. Mixed threat signals warrant user verification per rules_1.txt Rule 9."
D2,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Packer detected (1) + ActiveX objects (1) triggers Rule 5 dangerous code execution. High behavioral scores (sandbox 0.56, exfiltration 0.99) with obfuscation patterns. Good sender reputation (0.78) overridden by confirmed threat indicators. URL present with moderate reputation. Immediate blocking required."
D3,WARNING,0.75,"Legal threat request with very poor sender reputation (1.15e-08) and authentication failures (SPF fail, DMARC temperror). Urgency keywords high (0.89) indicating social engineering.

D4,SPAM,0.80,"Poor sender reputation (0.0015) with DMARC failure but no confirmed threats. High exfiltration score (0.77) without malware components suggests behavioral false positive. Content spam score moderate (0.085). Authentication pattern and reputation indicate bulk messaging without security threats."

D8,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Total components detected malicious (1) triggers Rule 2 automatic classification. Poor sender reputation with authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM policy) and SSL self-signed. Confirmed malicious components override all other signals requiring immediate blocking."
D9,WARNING,0.70,"Multiple authentication failures (SPF/DKIM/DMARC fail) with return path mismatch (1) and expired SSL certificate. High temp email likelihood (0.79) but low content spam score (0.007). Infrastructure concerns with auth failures require user verification."
D10,WARNING,0.65,"Meeting request with moderate behavioral scores (sandbox 0.06, exfiltration 0.65) and mixed authentication (DKIM policy). URL present with good reputation. Behavioral anomalies in medium range with authentication concerns warrant user verification per rules_1.txt Rule 9."
D11,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Total components detected malicious (3) with sensitive data request triggers Rule 2. High SMTP reputation (0.88) overridden by confirmed malicious components. SSL self-signed adds support. Confirmed threats require immediate blocking regardless of other signals."
D12,SPAM,0.75,"Poor sender reputation (0.0003) with authentication failures (SPF fail) and SSL self-signed. No confirmed malware detected. Content spam patterns with poor reputation but no high-risk requests indicate bulk messaging classification per rules_1.txt Rule 15."
D13,NO ACTION,0.85,"Good sender reputation (0.41) with very low behavioral scores across all metrics (<0.05). Despite minor authentication issues (SPF softfail, DKIM policy), excellent threat profile and reputation indicate legitimate email per rules_1.txt Rule 21."
D14,NO ACTION,0.80,"Link click request with very low behavioral scores and good SSL certificate. Despite authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM none), extremely low threat indicators across all metrics and clean security profile indicate legitimate content per rules_1.txt Rule 21."
D15,WARNING,0.70,"High behavioral scores (sandbox 0.32, exfiltration 0.91) without confirmed threats. Good sender reputation (0.83) but authentication failures (DKIM fail, DMARC fail). URL present with good reputation. Mixed signals require user verification per rules_1.txt Rule 9."
D16,WARNING,0.75,"Invoice payment request (high-risk financial) with authentication issues (DKIM fail) and poor sender reputation (2.1e-06). URL present with good reputation but financial request type with mixed authentication requires user verification per rules_1.txt Rule 10."
D17,WARNING,0.65,"Mixed authentication results (SPF pass, DKIM fail, DMARC fail) with moderate behavioral sandbox score (0.24). Good URL reputation but authentication inconsistencies with behavioral concerns require verification per rules_1.txt Rule 11."

D20,WARNING,0.70,"Single authentication failure (SPF fail) with SSL certificate mismatch and poor sender reputation (0.002). Content spam score low (0.22) doesn't meet spam threshold. Infrastructure concerns with auth failure require user verification per rules_1.txt Rule 12."
D21,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Total components detected malicious (1) + gift card request + authentication failures (SPF fail) triggers Rules 2 & 6. Expired SSL certificate supports classification. Financial fraud pattern with confirmed malicious components requires immediate blocking."
D22,NO ACTION,0.90,"DMARC enforced (1) with good authentication (SPF pass, DKIM pass) and all malicious indicators zero. Very low threat scores and clean security profile. Strong security indicators require no action per rules_1.txt Rule 19."
D23,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Total YARA match count (7) with credential request and URL shortener detected triggers Rule 2. Authentication failures (SPF fail, DMARC fail) support classification. Known malware patterns with high-risk request require immediate blocking."
D24,MALICIOUS,0.90,"Executable attachment (1) with high exfiltration score (0.575) and authentication failures (SPF/DKIM fail) triggers Rule 4. High-risk role targeted (1) adds concern. Executable threats with high behavioral scores require immediate blocking."
D25,MALICIOUS,0.95,"Final URL known malicious (1) triggers Rule 1 automatic classification. Meeting request with known malicious destination and SSL self-signed. Malicious URL endpoint overrides all other signals requiring immediate blocking."
D26,WARNING,0.70,"Multiple authentication failures (DKIM fail, DMARC fail) with SSL certificate mismatch but low content spam score (0.003). Poor sender reputation but doesn't meet spam threshold. Infrastructure and authentication concerns require user verification."
D27,NO ACTION,0.80,"Good authentication (SPF pass) with very low threat scores and clean behavioral profile. Despite minor SSL mismatch, overall clean profile with good authentication indicates legitimate business communication per rules_1.txt Rule 20."
