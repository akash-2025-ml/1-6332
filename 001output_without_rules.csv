Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D1,Warning,0.75,"High exfiltration behavior score (0.902) and moderate metadata suspicion (0.488) combined with authentication failures (SPF softfail, DKIM policy, DMARC fail) indicate potential compromise. Moderate temp email likelihood (0.476) adds concern. No direct malicious indicators but behavioral and authentication patterns suggest suspicious activity."
D2,Malicious,0.85,"Multiple critical threat indicators: packer detected (1), very high exfiltration behavior score (0.993), ActiveX objects present, and 2 embedded files. Moderate behavioral sandbox score (0.564) with authentication failures. Despite good domain reputation, technical indicators strongly suggest malicious payload delivery mechanism."
D3,Warning,0.65,"Legal threat request type combined with extremely low domain reputation (1.15e-08) and authentication failures (SPF fail, DMARC temperror) suggests social engineering attempt. Outdated SSL protocol adds infrastructure concern. Low behavioral scores prevent malicious classification but pattern indicates phishing."
D4,Warning,0.70,"Low domain reputation (0.0015) with high exfiltration behavior score (0.770) and very high suspicious string entropy (0.629). Seven embedded files present significant risk. Mixed authentication results with DMARC failure. Cumulative indicators suggest potential threat without overt malicious confirmation."
D5,Spam,0.80,"Very low domain reputation (4.93e-10) and high content spam score (0.689) with authentication failures (DKIM fail, DMARC fail). High SMTP IP geo risk (0.401) but no behavioral threats or malicious indicators. Clear spam pattern without malicious intent."
D6,Warning,0.65,"Invoice verification request type with self-signed SSL certificate and low domain reputation (0.084). Moderate URL reputation (0.328) with good reverse DNS but mixed authentication. Financial request combined with suspicious infrastructure warrants caution."
D7,Warning,0.70,"High exfiltration behavior score (0.895) and metadata suspicion (0.301) despite all authentication passing. Self-signed SSL certificate and embedded file present concern. Good SMTP reputation balanced against behavioral indicators suggests sophisticated threat."
D8,Spam,0.75,"Very low domain reputation (4.54e-05) with high content spam score (0.805) and authentication failures. One malicious component detected but minimal other threats. Self-signed SSL adds suspicion. Primary pattern indicates spam with minor malicious elements."
D9,Warning,0.80,"High temp email likelihood (0.788) with return path mismatch and all authentication failures. Expired SSL certificate with high geo/ASN risk scores. Multiple infrastructure and authentication issues create significant concern despite no direct malicious indicators."
D10,Warning,0.65,"Meeting request type with high sender name VIP similarity (0.473) suggests impersonation attempt. Mixed authentication results and moderate content spam score (0.334). Valid SSL but potential social engineering through meeting invitation makes this concerning."
